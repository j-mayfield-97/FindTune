# FindTune
A Repository for Team 6 in section A5 for the 411: Software Engineering course.

We aim to let users find new and interesting music with ease. Sit in your seat and just listen.
We use Microsoft Azure Face API to track your emotion and the Spotify API to find songs.
Depending on your reaction, we will either save it to a playlist or find a different song for you!

Dependencies:
- Node
- MongoDB

Currently not deployed, test using the command: `node src/app.js`
